If you want to help add timestamps to the YouTube videos found here: https://www.youtube.com/user/julialanguage, please follow the below steps:
- See the time stamps in the description here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGojI9xcCfg&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q2Kr16aWPOKE0dz9OnsnIJ&index=2 for an example of what you should do. 
- Find a video without time stamps that interests you
- Create a new markdown file in the `videos` folder name with the title of the video.
- Watch the video and add descriptive timestamps to the issue you opened (see here for an example: https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/YouTubeVideoTimestamps/issues/84)
- Once the timestamps are accepted, we will add a S/o to you in the video description as a thank you for your help and you will get a `hacktoberfest-accepted` label on the PR.
