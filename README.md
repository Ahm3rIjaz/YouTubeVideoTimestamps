# YouTube Timestamps

Repo to track the progress of adding time stamps to the Julia Language's YouTube videos.

## Get Involved


If you want to help add timestamps to the YouTube videos found here: https://www.youtube.com/user/julialanguage, please follow the below steps:
- See the time stamps in the description here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGojI9xcCfg&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q2Kr16aWPOKE0dz9OnsnIJ&index=2 for an example of what you should do. 
- Find a video without time stamps that interests you
- Look at this repo's issues to make sure there is no existing issue with the vieo title (make sure you look at closed issues too)
- Open a new issue with the videos title to "claim" the video such that there's no overlapping work
- Watch the video and add descriptive descriptions to the issue you opened
- Ping @logankilpatrick once you are done and we will review
- Once the description is accepted we will add a S/o to you in the video description as a thank you for your help! 

Thank you! #JuliaLang
